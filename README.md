It focuses on building a ML model that can classify movies into genres based on their plot descriptions. This project creates a machine learning model that uses plot descriptions to categorize films into different genres. In order to transform unstructured text into features that can be used for modeling, it investigates various classifiers and applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Based on the textual plot description, find out the genre of a film. Use TF-IDF to preprocess and vectorize the movie plot text. Train and assess several classifiers, such as SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Look at feature significance and incorrect classifications to increase understanding and precision.
